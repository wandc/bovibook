SSL needs to be enabled on apache2. self sign cert


sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/apache-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/apache-selfsigned.crt
sudo a2enmod ssl

move sertificate out of privcate dir becasue of permissions issue. need to fix this.
sudo cp /etc/ssl/private/apache-selfsigned.key /etc/ssl/apache-selfsigned.key


login needs default search path to wcauthentication for c3po , would be better because of how Oauth2 was written.
ALTER USER user SET search_path TO accountschema;

need to change garbage collection time, so we don't need to login all the time, set to 2 weeks.
sudo nano /etc/php/7.0/apache2/php.ini
change to: session.gc_maxlifetime = 604800

make postgres start at boot
sudo update-rc.d postgresql enable
